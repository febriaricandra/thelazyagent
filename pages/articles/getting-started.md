## Get started with Markdoc

Markdoc is a static site generator that uses Markdown files as input and outputs HTML files.

Markdoc features several core concepts which include:

- **Nodes**:
  These are the elements that Markdoc inherits from Markdown
- **Tags**:
  Tags are the main syntactic extension that Markdoc adds on top of Markdown. Similar to HTML, each tag is enclosed with `{%` and `%}` and includes the tag name, attributes, and the content body.
- **Annotations**:
  These can be added to nodes to customize how they are rendered

### Installation

To install markdoc in Next.js, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @markdoc/next.js @markdoc/markdoc
```

reactjs example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Markdoc } from "@markdoc/next.js";
import { MarkdocProvider } from "@markdoc/markdoc";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <MarkdocProvider>
      <Markdoc
        source={`
          # Hello World
          This is a paragraph
        `}
      />
